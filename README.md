👋 Hey, I’m Velsaravanan
🔭 I’m not just learning to code — I’m learning to build things that matter. Products that solve real problems. Tools that lift even a small group of people. That’s the goal. That’s the fire.

🚀 Right now, I’m focused on React Native and the MERN stack — because mobile-first, full-stack thinking is the fastest way to turn bold ideas into real impact.

🤖 I’m drawn to Artificial Intelligence not because it’s trendy, but because it’s inevitable. It’s going to reshape everything — and I want to help steer that wave toward something good. Tech can empower. Or destroy. I choose to build for the better.

⚙️ On quieter days, I find joy in the foundations — operating systems, C programming, transistors, electronics. I like to peek under the hood. It grounds me.

🤝 If you’re building something meaningful, something weird, or something that makes people feel something — let’s talk. I believe in ambitious ideas and honest work.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I often break things just to understand them. It’s chaos. It’s learning. I love it.
